        "answer": "The D flip-flop can be used as a basic building block for the JK flip-flop. The following diagram shows the circuit with the combinational logic added:\n\nThe circuit connects the J and K inputs to two NOR gates (with inverted inputs) that are wired in parallel. The output of these two NOR gates is then connected to the D input of the flip-flop, while the clock and inverted clock signals are connected to the clock (C) and inverted clock (C') inputs, respectively. \n\nThis circuit ensures that when J and K are both 0, the D input remains 0 and Q retains its previous value. When J is 1, D is set to 1, resulting in the Q output becoming 1. When K is 1, D is set to 0, resulting in the Q output becoming 0.

We can do this with two AND gates, an inverter, and the JK flip flop. \n\nFirst, we set K = D and J = D'; then we connect the output of the inverter to one input of each AND gate and D to the other input of the first AND gate and D' to the other input of the second AND gate. Finally, we connect the output of the first AND gate to J and the output of the second AND gate to K.\n\nThe schematic looks like this:\n\n[img]\n\nWhen the clock signal rises, the inputs to the JK flip flop will be J = D' and K = D.

        "question": "Which of the circuits in the figure are synchronous sequential circuits? Explain.",

The flip flops in both circuits provide feedback from the outputs back to the inputs, allowing them to remember their previous states. This makes them synchronous sequential circuits."
