        "answer": "The circuit shown below can implement the desired behaviour. The inputs to the circuit are the clock signal and the two J and K inputs. The outputs are Q and Q_bar.\n\nTo construct the circuit, we need a JK flip-flop, two NAND gates, and two inverters. The output Q of the JK flip-flop is connected to one input of each NAND gate, while one of the NAND gate inputs is connected to the J and K inputs and the other to the clock signal and its complement. The other inputs to the JK flip-flop are the output of the NAND gates, with one inverted by an inverter.\n\nThe circuit works as follows. When the clock signal rises and J and K are 0, the output of the flip-flop will retain its old value (Q). If one of J or K is 1 and the other is 0, the output of the respective NAND gate will be 0, and thus the output of the flip-flop will be 1 (Q=1) or 0 (Q=0) respectively. Finally, if both J and K are 1, the output of the flip-flops will be the opposite of its old value, as both NAND gates will become 0 and the flip-flop's J and K inputs will become 1 and 0 respectively. \n\n[Insert image of circuit here]"
