The Q output of the flip-flop is connected to the second NAND gate.\n\nThis circuit is triggered by the rising edge of the clock. When the clock rises, the JK flip-flop changes state depending on the values of its inputs J and K. If the D input is 0, the output of one NAND gate will be logic 1, making J = 1 and K = 0. This causes the Q output of the JK flip-flop to become 1. Otherwise, if the D input is 1, the Q output of the JK flip-flop becomes 0."

An important feature of synchronous circuits is that they use a clock signal to ensure that each state transition occurs at a regular interval. This ensures that the system maintains its output sequence. In Circuits 1 and 2, rising or falling clock edges are used to enable or disable each state element, which allows them to transition from one state to the next in a predictable manner."
