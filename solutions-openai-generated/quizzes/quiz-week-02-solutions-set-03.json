    "Question A": {
        "question": "List the names of one-input and two-input logic gates, excluding XOR and XNOR.",
        "answer": "One-input logic gates:\nNOT (or \"inverter\")\n\nTwo-input logic gates:\nAND \nOR \nNAND \nNOR"
    },
    "Question B": {
        "question": "What is the difference between OR and XOR gate?",
        "answer": "The OR gate produces a high output (1) if any of its inputs is high. The XOR gate produces a high output if either, but not both, of its inputs is high."
    },
    "Question C": {
        "question": "Can we have more than two-input gates?",
        "answer": "Yes, there are a variety of mult-input gates available. For example, three-input AND gates, four-input OR gates, and seven-input NAND gates are all available."
    },
    "Question D": {
        "question": "What is the purpose of \"bubble pushing\"?",
        "answer": "Bubble pushing is a strategy that is used by investors to temporarily increase the price of a stock. It involves buying large amounts of shares of a stock and then selling them as soon as the price rises due to the increased demand. This can create an artificial short-term increase in the price of the stock, which can then be used to generate a profit for the investor."
