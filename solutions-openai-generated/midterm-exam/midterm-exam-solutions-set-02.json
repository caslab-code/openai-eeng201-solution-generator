        "question": "A diagram of a dual in-line package (DIP) module containing 4 NOR gates is shown in the figure, it is similar to modules available in lab 1 project. Describe how would you connect the pins of the module to realize the Boolean expression Y = AC\u2019 + B\u2019C\u2019. Do this by drawing the module and the connections (wires) of your solution. Since the module only has NOR gates, you need to convert the expression for Y into equivalent one using only NOR gates. Then, for each pin (1 to 14) of the module, you should show if it\u2019s connected to A, B, C, Y, Ground, VDD, or if the pin is connected to another pin of the module, or if the pin not connected. You can use any number of NOR gates, not all NOR gates of the module need to be used, if some NOR gates are unused label the pins as unconnected.",
